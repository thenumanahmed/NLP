Urbanization is changing the way people live, work, and interact. As more people move to cities, urban areas are expanding rapidly, leading to challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, and strain on infrastructure. Urban planning and smart city initiatives aim to address these challenges by creating sustainable and efficient urban environments.
