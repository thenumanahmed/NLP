Previewing the technological frontier, Next.js 14 unveils Partial Prerendering, an optimization within the compiler targeting dynamic content, ensuring a swift initial static response. Rooted in a decade of research spanning server-side rendering (SSR), static-site generation (SSG), and incremental static revalidation (ISR), this feature beckons a paradigm shift.
The rationale behind embracing Partial Prerendering lies in simplifying the existing model without burdening developers with the learning curve of new APIs. It aspires to deliver the speed and reliability of static rendering while accommodating fully dynamic, personalized responses, all without necessitating the acquisition of new knowledge.
The underpinnings of Partial Prerendering within Next.js 14 rest upon the innovative framework of React Suspense. Its mechanism involves crafting a static shell based on Suspense boundaries, with the prerendered fallback from React Suspense paving the way for dynamic components to seamlessly integrate upon request.
