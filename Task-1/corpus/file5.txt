The execution of Partial Prerendering entails an instantaneous serving of a static HTML shell upon request. Forging this shell from predefined boundaries and the prerendered React Suspense fallback, dynamic components, encompassing tasks like reading cookies or displaying personalized banners, are seamlessly streamed in tandem with the static shell. This innovative approach obviates the need for extraneous network round trips.
As a work in active progress, the evolution of Partial Prerendering unfolds with a promise of continual updates and refinements in forthcoming minor releases of Next.js. The overarching objective is to augment the developer experience and elevate the performance benchmark of web applications.
In the realm of metadata, Next.js 14 introduces pivotal refinements to enrich the user experience. By preventing flickering caused by alterations in theme color or layout shifts stemming from viewport changes, these enhancements ensure that only select metadata options block, permitting non-blocking metadata to coexist seamlessly with a partially prerendered page.
