A novel inclusion in Next.js 14, Server Actions serves to simplify the intricate process of crafting data mutations. By enabling developers to define functions executed securely on the server, directly callable from React components, this feature harmonizes with fundamental web concepts, such as forms and the FormData Web API, thus resonating with those accustomed to server-centric frameworks.
The pervasive integration of Server Actions into the App Router model augments the capabilities offered. From revalidating cached data to redirecting routes, setting and reading cookies, and handling optimistic UI updates, this comprehensive integration streamlines development workflows and elevates the overall performance of web applications.
